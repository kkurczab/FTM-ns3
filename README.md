# FTM-ns3
The FTM protocol implementation in the NS3 simulator, provided by https://github.com/tkn-tub/wifi-ftm-ns3 and edited by me for the purpose of my Master Thesis.

In order to enable convenient  simulations, I added different simulation parameters, in the form of command line arguments to the https://github.com/kkurczab/FTM-ns3/blob/main/scratch/ftm-example.cc script. Additionally, the default setting is listed after running the **./waf --run "ftm-example --PrintHelp** command.
